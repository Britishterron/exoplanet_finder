# Tkinter GUI for light curve analysis of TESS // KEPLER observations. 

This GUI is a simple extension of the _lightkurve_ python library that allows astronomy enthusiasts to study light curves (only from TESS or KEPLER missions), look for exoplanet transits and simulate atmospheric temperature of potential exoplanets. 

Features to be added:

• Export all results to .csv
• Fix the "help" window (right now it's just a ChatGPT text placeholder)
