# Tkinter GUI for light curve analysis of TESS // KEPLER observations. 

This GUI is a simple extension of the _lightkurve_ python library that allows astronomy enthusiasts to study light curves (only from TESS or KEPLER missions), look for exoplanet transits and simulate atmospheric temperature of potential exoplanets.
